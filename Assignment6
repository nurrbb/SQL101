Q:


1) What is the average value of the rental_rate column in the film table?

2) How many films in the film table start with the character 'C'?

3) For the films in the film table where the rental_rate value is equal to 0.99, what is the length of the longest film (in minutes)?

4) For the films in the film table with a length greater than 150 minutes, how many distinct replacement_cost values are there?


A:

1) SELECT ROUND(AVG(rental_rate),2) FROM film

2) SELECT COUNT (title) FROM film WHERE title LIKE 'C%'

3) SELECT MAX(length) FROM film WHERE rental_rate = 0.99

4)  SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(replacement_cost) FROM film WHERE length>150;
