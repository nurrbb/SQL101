Q)

1) Sort all the data in the film table where the replacement cost value is greater than or equal to 12.99 and less than 16.99 (use the BETWEEN - AND structure).

2) Sort the data in the actor table where the values in the first_name and last_name columns are either 'Penelope', 'Nick', or 'Ed' (use the IN operator).

3) Sort all the data in the film table where the rental_rate values are 0.99, 2.99, or 4.99, and the replacement_cost values are 12.99, 15.99, or 28.99 (use the IN operator).

A)

1) SELECT * FROM film 
   WHERE replacement_cost BETWEEN 12.99 AND 16.99;

2) SELECT first_name,last_name FROM actor 
   WHERE first_name IN('Penelope','Nick','Ed');

3) SELECT * FROM film 
   WHERE rental_rate IN(0.99, 2.99, 4.99) AND replacement_cost IN(12.99, 15.99, 28.99);
