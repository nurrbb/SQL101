Q:

1) List the top 5 longest films (by length) whose titles end with the character 'n' in the film table.

2) List the next 5 shortest films (with lengths 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) whose titles end with the character 'n' in the film table.

3) Sort the first 4 records in descending order based on the last_name column in the customer table, with the condition that the store_id is 1.

A:

1) SELECT title FROM film WHERE title ILIKE '%n' ORDER BY length LIMIT 5

2) SELECT title FROM film WHERE title ILIKE '%n' ORDER BY length DESC LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5

3) SELECT last_name FROM customer WHERE store_id=1 ORDER BY last_name DESC LIMIT 4
